    <h1 class="hello-world">Nathan's Hobbies</h1>
    <p>This is going to be a brief essay on some of the things that I enjoy doing. When I reflect on my hobbies and things I like to do, three things come to mind; music, film, and history. Those are my three favorite fields and recreational pastimes, I will explain what makes them my favorite and why I enjoy them so much.</p>
    <p>First, I will begin with music. Music has been my favorite hobby for a long time. I enjoy making music, listening to music, and discussing music. Some of my favorite musical artists are Neil Young, Kraftwerk, and Tom Waits. I like many other artists and bands but those are a few of my favorites. When it comes to making music, I can play the guitar, bass, piano, and the drums. I use most of these instruments while making music.</p>

   <p>Next, I will discuss my love of film. My love for movies began a year or two ago, making it one of my newer interests. Some of my favorite movies are 2001 a Space Odyssey, Aguirre: The Wrath of God, and Taxi Driver. Watching movies has quickly become one of my favorite pastimes.</p>

    <p>Lastly, is my love for history. My love for history began in elementary school when I read a book on the Aztecs. My favorite area to study is ancient civilizations and theology. I primarily hae studied a lot of European, Middle Eastern, and Mesoamerican history. I plan on learning more about eastern history as well.</p>
